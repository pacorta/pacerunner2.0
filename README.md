# Pacebud Progress Log: August 26-28

## Goal State Management & Run Completion System

Fixed a persistent goal issue and built a comprehensive run completion system that tracks goal outcomes and celebrates user achievements.

---

### Goal State Cleanup Fix

- **Problem**: Running goals persisted on the home screen after completing or discarding runs, causing confusion and potential data corruption
- **Root Cause**: Goal state stored in multiple providers (`customDistanceProvider`, `customPaceProvider`, `readablePaceProvider`, and temporary selection providers) wasn't being cleared when users finished their runs
- **Solution**: Created centralized `clearGoalProviders(ref)` helper function in `inline_goal_input.dart` that resets all goal-related state
- **Implementation**: Called this helper in three key places:
  - When saving a run in `RunSummaryScreen`
  - When discarding a run in `RunSummaryScreen` 
  - When discarding a run directly from `CurrentRun` (active run screen)
- **Result**: Home screen now always returns to clean "no goal" state regardless of how users exit a run, forcing fresh goal setup for each new session

---

### End-of-Run Alert Dialog Redesign

- Moved the end-of-run alert dialog to its own standalone screen for better user experience and cleaner code organization

---

### Goal Outcome Tracking System

- **Goal Progress Provider**: Created `goal_progress_provider.dart` to capture the exact time when target distance is first reached during a run
- **Integration**: Added logic in `current_run.dart` to listen for distance updates and record first-reach milestones
- **Smart Messaging**: Updated `run_summary_screen.dart` to show different messages based on goal completion:
  - **Distance+Time goals**: "You met your goal!" if first reach of target distance occurs at/before target time; otherwise "Maybe next time üòÖ" with either "You were short by X km/mi" (if never reached distance) or "You were off your goal by Xm Ys" (if reached distance late)
  - **Distance-only goals**: "You met your goal!" if final distance ‚â• target; otherwise "Maybe next time üòÖ" with "You were short by X km/mi"
  - **Time-only goals**: "You met your goal!" if final elapsed time ‚â• target; otherwise "Maybe next time üòÖ" with "You were short by Xm Ys"
- **Edge Case Handling**: System handles users stopping early or continuing past goal distance, ensuring accurate feedback regardless of when they finish

### Confetti Celebration System

- **Package Integration**: Added `confetti` package in `pubspec.yaml` for celebration animations
- **Controller Setup**: Implemented `ConfettiController` in `run_summary_screen.dart` with 3-second duration and explosive blast pattern
- **Automatic Triggering**: Confetti fires automatically when any goal type is met (distance+time, distance-only, or time-only)
- **Manual Celebration**: Added manual confetti button (üéâ) positioned along header area for user-triggered celebrations
- **Visual Design**: Confetti widget positioned at top center with colorful particles (purple, white, red)
- **Persistent Flag System**: Prevents multiple confetti plays on screen rebuilds

---

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Main Changes**: Added confetti import and controller initialization in `RunSummaryScreen`, wrapped entire screen in `Stack` to overlay confetti and celebration button
- **Unified Logic**: Single celebration trigger covers all three goal types
- **Secondary Improvements**:
  - **Distance-only goals**: confetti fires when final distance ‚â• target distance
  - **Time-only goals**: confetti fires when final elapsed time ‚â• target time
  - **Distance+Time goals**: confetti fires when target distance reached at/before target time
- **Button Styling**: Celebration button styled with red accent and emoji icon for better visual appeal

---

### Other Improvements

- Added red-when-above logic to finish time projection in run screen
- Fixed colliding logic in home screen 'start run' button

---

### What's Next
- Fix ‚ÄúGoogle Maps Authentication Failed‚Äù
    - After the loading of GPS, there's another loading screen. I think this might be solved with fixing this alert.
    - I hope this fix will also make these errors disappear:
```
flutter: LocationService: Starting location tracking...
 This method can cause UI unresponsiveness if invoked on the main thread. Instead, consider waiting for the `-locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization:` callback and checking `authorizationStatus` first.
flutter: LocationService: "Always" permission already granted.

```
- Live activities loading bar for user's goal
- Sound effects for goal achievements
- Save user's goal to the database.
- Save whether the user met their goal or not.
- Modify the weekly line chart to handle month and year.
- Maybe: Add precipitation % chances in home screen (there's a lot of dead space that I need to fill according to my friend Tristan). I'll see how viable it is to add this; most likely easy.
- Maybe: split average pace data during run
    - Split average pace line chart inside run info.
- Maybe: calories and other common data inside the run info.
