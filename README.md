# Pacebud Progress: 8/5/2025

## Stable Pace & Prediction System

Implemented a stable average pace provider to eliminate jumpy data and added accurate finish time predictions for goal-focused runners.

### Stable Average Pace Implementation

- Created time throttling (2-second intervals) and data smoothing (3-value moving average) to replace the jumpy average pace display. Similar to how Strava handles pace calculations for consistent UX.
- Projected Finish Time System: Added real-time predictions showing "At your current pace, you'll finish in X time" based on stable pace calculations rather than instant pace data (previous 'current pace' approach).
- Critical Unit Conversion Fix: Resolved incorrect pace calculations when using kilometers that was causing wrong predictions (showing "fast" when actually running slow). The issue was in pace selection where km distances were being incorrectly normalized to miles before calculation.

## How this was achieved

- Two-strategy approach: Time throttling prevents constant updates, data smoothing uses moving average of recent values.
- Created new providers for target distance/time that integrate with existing custom pace system.
- Built compact prediction display widget to fit existing UI without overflow.
- Connected stable pace provider to prediction system using string-to-seconds parsing.

## Conclusion

This marks the end of my first iteration of the "current pace" approach. At the beginning of the project, I thought showing the user's pace over the last few seconds (4s window) would be the best way to alert them if they were going too slow or fast. But after running again consistently, I realized that what runners truly care about is simpler: 

> “If I keep going at this pace, when will I finish my goal distance?”

That question is fully answered by the **stable average pace**, not the jumpy pace from the last few seconds. This new approach solves two essential needs:
1. It reflects how long the runner has been running, including adjustments from recent speed changes.
2. It enables an accurate **projected finish time**, which is far more actionable and goal-oriented than short-term pace feedback.

Ironically, once I returned to running regularly, the solution became clear. I had been overcomplicating things. What runners need is clarity, not noise. And to design for that, I had to take a step back and think like a runner, not just a developer.

## Result

The app now provides:

- **Stable, smoothed average pace calculations** using time throttling and moving averages.
- **Accurate, real-time finish time predictions** based on consistent pace.
- Full support for **both kilometers and miles**, with corrected unit conversion logic.

This makes the running experience more reliable and intuitive for goal-driven users.

## Next Steps

- Modify the pacebar so it reflects the gap between the **goal pace** (green zone) and the **projected finish**.
- Add run mode selection system and prepare framework for future running modes.
