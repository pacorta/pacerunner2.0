# Pacebud Progress Log: September 15-16th, 2025

## Sign in with apple ID setup

I tried uploading this app for apple review and they told me I needed to:
- Update the screenshots so that they don't have the "debug" banner flutter provides
- Add another sign-in method (Guideline 4.8 - Login Services)
- Add a test sign-in method for them to test the app (Guideline 2.1)

1. **Dependencies**:
   - `sign_in_with_apple: ^6.1.0`
   - `crypto: ^3.0.3`

2. **Apple Developer Console**:
   - Enabled "Sign in with Apple" capability for App ID
   - Created Services ID `com.orzan.pacebud.service` (not used in final config)
   - Generated .p8 private key with Key ID
   - Configured website URLs

3. **Firebase Console**:
   - Enabled Apple as sign-in provider
   - Learned that "Services ID" field should use the main App ID (`com.orzan.pacerunner`), not the separate Services ID
   - Configured with Apple Team ID, Key ID, and private key

4. **iOS Configuration**:
   - Added `com.apple.developer.applesignin` entitlement to `Runner.entitlements`
   - iOS deployment target already â‰¥ 13.0 (required for Sign in with Apple)

5. **Code Implementation**:
   - Secure nonce generation (SHA-256 hashing)
   - Native Apple ID credential request with email and fullName scopes
   - Firebase OAuth credential creation with `apple.com` provider
   - Error handling for account conflicts and credential issues
   - Display name updates from Apple ID information
   - Custom button (matches Google Sign In)

### Lesson Learned:
- For iOS native, Firebase needs the main App ID in the field "services ID", not a separate Services ID. The Firebase documentation is confusing in this matter; it says "Services ID (not required for Apple)" but then requires the App ID in that field for token validation.

## Location Listener

Added mechanism to detect when the user leaves the app to stop tracking automatically.

- Used WidgetsBindingObserver with runStateProvider according to the existing flow:
1. tracking begins at HomeScreen.initState() for pre-warming
2. tracking stops at CurrentRun.dispose()

- Location trcking stayed active because there was no listener for the app's lifecycle

- `RunState.running` and `RunState.paused` are considered active sessions

**Code Implementation:**
```dart
final isRunning = runState == RunState.running || runState == RunState.paused;

if (!isRunning && LocationService.isInitialized) {
  await LocationService.stopLocationTracking();
}
```

## GPS Status Spam Fix (Logout)

Fixed issue where LocationService would spam GPS status update errors after user logout.

**Problem:** When user logs out, RootShell gets disposed but LocationService continues trying to update GPS status with an invalid WidgetRef, causing console spam:
```
flutter: LocationService: GPS status update failed (widget disposed): Bad state: Cannot use "ref" after the widget was disposed.
```

**Solution:**
1. LocationService.dispose() called when user logs out
2. When ref becomes invalid, clear it immediately to prevent spam
3. If ref is cleared while tracking, automatically stop LocationService
4. **Protected all GPS status update methods** with ref validation and cleanup

## Goal Achievement Data

Added goal achievement tracking and data persistence to Firebase for all three goal types.

**Goal Types Supported:**
1. **Time Only Goal** (e.g., "Run for 30 minutes")
2. **Distance Only Goal** (e.g., "Run 5km") 
3. **Distance Under Time Goal** (e.g., "Run 5km in under 30 minutes")

**Data Saved to Firebase:**
- `goalAchieved`: Boolean indicating if the user met their objective
- `goalCompletionTimeSeconds`: Time when the goal was reached (null if not achieved)
- `totalRunTimeSeconds`: Total duration of the entire run

**Implementation Details:**
- Reuses existing confetti logic to determine goal achievement
- For distance-based goals: saves time when target distance was first reached
- For time-only goals: saves target time as completion time when achieved
- Captures both objective completion time AND total run duration for comprehensive analytics

**Example Scenario:**
```
Goal: 5km in under 30 minutes
Reality: User runs 6km in 32 minutes, reaching 5km at 25 minutes

Saved Data:
- goalAchieved: true (25min < 30min)
- goalCompletionTimeSeconds: 1500 (25 minutes)
- totalRunTimeSeconds: 1920 (32 minutes)
```

## Dialogs
### 1. Added/improved alert dialogs for:
- About Pacebud: Included "send feedback button" with LSApplicationQueriesSchemes (info.plist)
- Data deletion
- User log out
- First time usage location instructions (maybeShowFirstLaunchPermissionGuide)
- First time usage goal setup instructions (maybeShowFirstLaunchPermissionGuide) (asks right before going to run screen)
- No location warning --> Go to settings

### 2. Centralized settings sheet into its own component

### What's Next
- Launch for real user testing.
- Add more stats (split pace stats + charts, elevation, elevation gain, cadence, etc.)
