# Pacebud Progress Log: September 15-16th, 2025

## Account Deletion Feature - Apple App Store Compliance

Implemented comprehensive account deletion functionality to meet Apple App Store Review Guidelines 5.1.1(v), which requires "apps that support account creation to also allow users to delete their accounts".

### **Features**

**1. Account Deletion UI:**
- Added "Delete Account" option in Settings → Account settings
- Easy to find and access (Apple requirement)
- Clear visual hierarchy with warning indicators

**2. Complete Data Deletion:**
- Deletes user's Firebase Auth account
- Removes all user data from Firestore:
  - All running activities and stats
  - User profile and settings
  - Complete data cleanup (not just deactivation)

**3. User Safety & Transparency:**
- Clear confirmation dialog explaining what will be deleted
- "You will lose:" section listing specific data types
- "This action cannot be undone" warning
- Multiple confirmation steps to prevent accidental deletion

**4. Security Compliance:**
- Handles Firebase re-authentication requirements
- When re-auth needed, forces user to sign out and sign in again
- No bypass options for security requirements

**5. Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of network failures
- Clear error messages for users
- Loading indicators during deletion process
- Automatic navigation to login after successful deletion

### **Apple App Store Compliance:**

**Easy to find**: Located in Settings → Account settings  
**Complete deletion**: Removes account + all associated data  
**Clear process**: User understands exactly what happens  
**No workarounds**: Cannot just deactivate or disable  
**Proper confirmation**: Multiple steps prevent accidents  
**Security compliant**: Respects Firebase re-authentication  

## UI/UX changes:
- "Help" button in goal input"
- Change wording in live activity ("under" instead of "in")
- Improved the onboarding to include the "About Pacebud" dialog.
- Added expandable "Account settings" section in Settings
- Reorganized Settings UI with better visual hierarchy
- Streamlined re-authentication flow with single "Sign Out" option

## What's Next
- Launch for real user testing and feedback.
- Add more stats (split pace stats + charts, elevation, elevation gain, cadence, etc.)
