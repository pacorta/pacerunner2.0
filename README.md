## More Accurate Pace Parsing and Prediction

Today I fixed a few details that were causing issues in the user experience: unit differences and some hidden conversions that were inflating times. This was necessary for the app to show what a runner expects to see.

### What Changed

- Centralized **pace parsing** in `utils/pace_utils.dart` with `parsePaceStringToSeconds`. A single place that converts "m:ss/mi" or "m:ss/km" to seconds per unit.
- Fixed **goal projection** in `projected_finish_provider.dart`:
  - Target distance is calculated in km.
  - If user runs in miles, pace is normalized to seconds/km before projecting. Result: consistent predictions in both km and miles.
- Simplified the `PaceBar`:
  - Stopped reconverting pace (it now comes in the chosen unit).
  - Added safe normalization to avoid zero divisions and weird values (icon no longer "jumps" if strange data comes in).

### Result

- Correct predicted finish time.
- Bar markers centered on desired time goal (goal is 6.1 miles in 1 hour, bar centers on 1hr)

- Set up a "run modes" view for future variants.
